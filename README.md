The Academy Awards, known as the Oscars, have long been a defining force in Hollywood, shaping public perception of artistic achievement. Over time, the phenomenon of Oscar Bait—films designed to appeal to the Academy’s tastes—has raised questions about the authenticity of these awards. Factors such as a film’s genre, release timing, budget, and star-studded casts have been historically linked to Oscar success.

## Project Overview
Motivated by the idea of Oscar Bait, our project explores the factors that contribute to a film winning an Academy Award. Using data-driven analysis and machine learning models, we examine measurable trends, such as revenue, budget, and genre, to determine the Academy’s preferences.

## Key Technical Skills:
Integrated live data from APIs for dynamic analysis
Built a fully functional Shiny app to visualize results
Performed extensive data preprocessing & exploratory data analysis
Developed and trained a predictive model with 72% accuracy on test data
Key Findings & Future Work
Although the Oscars are inherently subjective, our model identifies clear quantitative trends that distinguish winners from nominees. 

### In the future, we aim to:

Normalize revenue data for inflation adjustments
Develop category-specific models for more precise predictions
Incorporate new datasets to assess the impact of cast and director fame
Ultimately, while artistic quality remains immeasurable, our findings challenge the extent to which Oscar outcomes follow predictable, data-driven patterns. With our 2025 Oscar predictions in hand, we invite others to question the intersection of art, business, and influence in shaping cinematic history.
