Why should anyone care about this?
What is the project about?
Do not assume that your readers have any domain knowledge!
The burden of explanation as to what you are talking about is on you!
For example, if your project involves phylogenetic trees, do not assume that your audience has anything other than a basic, lay understanding of genetics.
Where did your data come from?
What kind of data was it?
Is there a link to the data or some other way for the reader to follow up on your work?
Be sure to cite / reference where your data came from!!
What are your findings?
What kind of statistical computations (if any) have you done to support those conclusions?
Again, while the R code will show how the calculation was performed, it is up to you to interpret, in English sentences, the results of these calculations.
Do not forget about units, axis labels, etc.
What are the limitations of your work?
Be clear so that others do not misinterpret your findings.
To what population do your results apply?
Do they generalize?
Could your work be extended with more data or computational power or time to analyze?
How could your study be improved?
Suggesting plausible extensions don’t weaken your work – they strengthen it by connecting it to future work.
What ethical considerations came about during the project?
How were you or weren’t you able to address those issues?
What did you learn beyond what we’ve covered in class?
Must include intro and final paragraph
